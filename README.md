# The PIIP Dataset
**Performance of International Organizations Project (PIIP) dataset, Version 1.0**

The PIIP is the most comprehensive dataset on the performance of international institutions. It includes performance ratings of 54 major institutions between 2008 and 2018 issued by the governments of Australia, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom and by the Multilateral Organization Performance Assessment Network (MOPAN), a network of major donor states. A wealth of additional information on these institutions, including on their policy autonomy, governance functions, and operational partnerships, is also provided.

The dataset was introduced in my book _Making International Institutions Work_. Please use the following citation:

Lall, Ranjit. 2023. _Making International Institutions Work: The Politics of Performance_. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.

This repository provides the PIIP in CSV format as well as a codebook providing a detailed description of all variables in the dataset. The codebook divides the variables into three categories: (1) identifier variables (institution and year); (2) indicators of institutional performance; and (3) explanatory variables (discussed in the book).

**Version 1.1 (August 2023)**

Version 1.1 adds lagged versions of the explanatory variables.
